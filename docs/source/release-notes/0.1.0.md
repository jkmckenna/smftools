smftools initial release. Pre-Alpha phase. J McKenna

Currently, this package (smftools-0.1.0) is going through rapid improvement (dependency handling accross Linux and Mac OS, testing, documentation, debugging) and is still too early in development for widespread use. The underlying functionality was originally developed as a collection of scripts for single molecule footprinting (SMF) experiments in our lab, but is being packaged/developed to facilitate the expansion of SMF to any lab that is interested in performing these styles of experiments/analyses. The alpha-phase package is expected to be available within a couple months, so stay tuned!
