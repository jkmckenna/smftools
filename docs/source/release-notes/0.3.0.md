Version 0.3.0 Has split the smftools dependencies into its core dependencies, as well as various optional dependencies depending on the user's intended use in order to keep the package as light as possible. The package can now use wither a CLI or a Python based backend for Samtools, Bedtools, and BedGraphToBigWig for smftools load functionality.
